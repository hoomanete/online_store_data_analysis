# Online Store Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing data from an online store using a sample database provided by MySQL. The analysis involves querying the database and performing data analysis using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Dataset and Database

### Dataset
You can use public datasets like the **Sample Database** provided by MySQL. This dataset includes several tables such as `customers`, `orders`, `orderdetails`, `products`, `payments`, and more.

- **Download the dataset**: You can download the SQL file from the following link:  
  [MySQL Sample Database](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/mysql-sample-database/)

### Database Setup
To set up the database:
1. Import the dataset into MySQL.
2. Use the `SOURCE` command in MySQL to execute the SQL file and create the database.

### Database Schema
Below is the schema of the MySQL sample database:

## Tasks and Queries in the Database

In this section, you will write several SQL queries to extract data from the database. Below are some suggested questions:

1. **Top Customers by Purchase Count**:  
   Query: List the top 10 customers based on the number of orders.

2. **Best-Selling Products**:  
   Query: List the top 5 products based on sales quantity.

3. **Payment Analysis**:  
   Query: Calculate the average payment amount per customer.

4. **Order Timing Analysis**:  
   Query: Count the number of orders per month.

5. **Loyal Customers**:  
   Query: List customers who have made more than 3 purchases.

## Tasks and Questions for Data Analysis with Python

After extracting data from the database, you can use Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data analysis and visualization. Below are some suggested tasks:

1. **Product Sales Analysis**:  
   Use `pandas` to calculate sales per product and visualize the results using `matplotlib`.

2. **Customer Behavior Analysis**:  
   Use `seaborn` to create scatter plots and histograms to analyze customer purchasing behavior.

3. **Order Timing Analysis**:  
   Use `pandas` to group orders by month and year, and visualize sales trends using `matplotlib`.

4. **Payment Analysis**:  
   Use `pandas` to calculate average payments and visualize their distribution using `seaborn`.

5. **Customer Loyalty Analysis**:  
   Use `pandas` to identify loyal customers and visualize their purchase counts using `matplotlib`.

## Project Execution Steps

1. **Set Up the Database**:  
   Import the dataset into MySQL.

2. **Write SQL Queries**:  
   Execute the above questions using SQL in MySQL.

3. **Connect Python to MySQL**:  
   Use libraries like `mysql-connector-python` or `SQLAlchemy` to connect Python to the MySQL database.

4. **Analyze Data**:  
   Analyze and visualize the extracted data using Python libraries.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `mysql-connector-python`, `SQLAlchemy`
